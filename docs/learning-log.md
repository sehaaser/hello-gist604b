**Student:** Stephanie Haaser  
**Date:** October 26, 2025

## What I Learned
In this assignment, I learned:
- GitHub structure
- Issues help teams create a better product by evaluating others work
- Documentation helps to communicate with others what is being developed and why

## Challenges and Solutions
Basic using Github was a significant challenge for me. Searching the internet for definitions helped a lot. I found StackOverflow particularly helpful.

## Connection to My GIS Career
The skills I worked on in this GitHub project will enhance my GIS career by enhancing my communication and documentation skills.

## Open Source Workflow Understanding
Creating my own repository (`hello-gist604b`) mirrors the open source contribution process. In real projects, developers fork existing repositories, make improvements, and submit contributions - similar to how I created this repository and linked it to the assignment system.
